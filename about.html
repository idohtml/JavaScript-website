            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
              Hi I'm Jacob - a talented photographer and a passionate web
              developer in the making. I have recently returned to school to
              pursue my dream of becoming a tech professional, and I'm eager to
              learn everything I can about web development. For me, photography
              is more than just a hobby - it's a way of life. I've always had a
              keen eye for capturing the beauty in the world around me and
              turning it into art. I loves exploring different techniques and
              experimenting with new equipment to enhance my skills and create
              stunning visuals. my dedication to my craft is evident in the
              quality of my work, and I takes great pride in every photograph I
              produces. But as much as he loves photography, I also have a
              strong interest in technology. I'm fascinated by the ways in which
              technology can be used to enhance our lives and create new
              opportunities. I believes that by combining my love of photography
              with my passion for technology, I can create something truly
              special and unique. That's why I have decided to go back to school
              and pursue a career in web development. I wants to learn
              everything he can about coding, programming, and web development
              so that I can create innovative digital experiences for my
              clients. I'm excited about the endless possibilities that
              technology offers and am eager to explore new ideas and push the
              boundaries of what is possible. Despite my busy schedule, I'm
              always makes time for my family. They are my everything, and I
              cherishes every moment I get to spends with them. I believes that
              my family's love and support are what motivate me to pursue my
              dreams and achieve my goals. In conclusion, I'm a talented and
              driven individual who is passionate about photography and
              technology. With my dedication and hard work, there is no doubt
              that I will achieve great things in my career and continue to
              create stunning works of art through my photography.
